# Jeffe Leaderboard

A simple project combining React, GraphQL and FaunaDB to provide a fun leaderboard for friends who game together on a particular discord.

## How does it work?

Auth is handled via Google Firebase
The DB is FaunaDB, and all queries and mutations are done through Graphql with the Apollo Client. The frontend is a simple React app, with no SSG or SSR
